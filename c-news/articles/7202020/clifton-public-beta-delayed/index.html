      The "Clifton Public Beta" was delayed due to griefs on "The House of Clifton". The delays are also the fault of Gage Talbott, Vice President of Clifton who is secretly poor.
      In an interview with Gage Talbott, he confirmed that he only has 30 cents in his Paypal account Here is a quote from the interview: <span class="i">bubbletoptag: "How much money do you currently have in your PayPal account",
      gagetalbott:"lol idk like 30 cents"</span> Although he said he confirms he will pay for the <span class="bold">a Lightning-8GB with 8 gigabytes of ram and 3VCores</span> but well be about <br/>
