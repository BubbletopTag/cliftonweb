      The server isn't working due to a networking problem. The server says it's up, it even shows the player count. When you try to connect it either times out or says "Unable to connect to
      world". The reason I assume the issue is due to the DDOS Protection is because the last time we attempted to use GalaxyGate, we didn't get DDOS Protection. The server proceeded to work
      just fine. But now that we have DDOS Protection, the server cannot for the life of it, Allow us into the server.<br/> 
      "This does not mean we have given up. Our Secretary of Technology; BubbletopTag
      has been working around the clock to get this server up" -Vice Presidet Sata <br/>
      We recently decided to try to remove DDOS Protection and Sumbitted a Support Ticket. But as of the time of writing, we have not gotten a response yet.
      We are hoping to be able to get this server up by 6:00PM Today(July 22, 2020).
